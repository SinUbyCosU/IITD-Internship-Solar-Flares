Project: UV Flash Analysis of Solar Flares using AIA 1600 Å and HMI Data
Description:

Reproduced Figure 1 and 2 from Sharma et al. (2017) with pixel-accurate alignment of SDO AIA and HMI data.

Handled SunPy-based preprocessing: derotation, WCS-based cropping, and photometric scaling.

Automated temporal co-registration and multi-panel visualization with exact replication of published format.

Built groundwork for further quantitative and ML-based flare analysis.

Skills: Python, SunPy, Astropy, AIA/HMI data, JSOC, Scientific Plotting
